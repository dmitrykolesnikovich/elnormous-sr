# Software Renderer
With this I am trying to implement the GPU rendering pipeline in software to understand the steps deeper. This project can be used for learning purposes (I try to keep the code clean).

# Features

* Indexed triangle rasterization
* Depth testing
* Alpha blending
* Texture mapping
* Custom shader support (via extending the Shader class)

This is a sample output of the renderer:
